* DARPA Robotics Challenge

  I am now working on full-body motion planning and control for DRC tasks such as getting the robot out of a car, opening doors and cleaning debris and etc. The robot is a large hydraulic humanoid robot named Atlas, which is provide by DARPA. 
  
  
  Before this, I've been working on a trajectory library approach for humanoid robot balancing and walking control. For more information, please visit [[http://rcir.sjtu.edu.cn/~cgliu/diss.html][HERE.]]
