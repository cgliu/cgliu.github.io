* About me
  I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with [[http://www.ri.cmu.edu/][Robotics Institute]], Carnegie Mellon University. I am now working with Prof. [[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cga/][Chris G. Atkeson]]. I received M.S. degree and Ph.D. degree in Control Theory and Control Engineering (Computer Science) in [[http://www.sjtu.edu.cn/][Shanghai Jiao Tong University]]. 


* Research Interests:
** COMMENT 
   To our human beings, all our life is about understanding and changing the world and ourselves for some purpose. 

   To the robots, the former calls perception and later calls control.    
   To achieve long-term goal with minimum cost, it need to plan.  

   Most of past work is focus on the control and planning, aiming to improve robot's mobility and manipulation capabilities.  
   and eventually achieve superb agility. 

   I resort to optimization technologies, such as parametric and nonparametric optimization, 
   trajectory optimizaation, Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement learning. 
  
** 
  - Legged robot locomotion and manipulation
  - Humanoid robot planning and control
  - High-speed visual servo
  - Advanced computer infrastructure for optimization-based planning and control
