  - Location: Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China 
  - Project Description: 
    - Ship-motion prediction will be very useful for several naval operations such as aircraft landing, cargo transfer, off-loading of small boats, and ship 'mating' between a big transport ship and some small ships. Five to ten seconds ship motion prediction can give the operator time to avoid serious collisions. For this purpose, this real-time ship motion forecast software can predict the ship motion for 10 to 20 seconds based on the measurements in the past. As Bachelor thesis project, it aims to implement a real-time on-line forecast software for ship motion extremely short-time prediction and integrate with CSSRC (China Ship Scientific Research Center), Wuxi, China, 
    - Programming Language: C++
    - Development Tools: Visual Studio 6.0
    - Interface: Ethernet and RS232

  - Requirements:
    - Communication Interface: Serial ports
    - Computational Time per one forecasting: Less than 100 ms
    - Forecast Step Length: Between 1 and 20
    - Easy to be integrated with different algorithms
    - Use friendly interface    

  - Responsibilities: 
    - Implemented the on-line forecast software using VC 6.0.
    - Integrated with the forecast system in CSSRC.

  - Accomplishments:
    - Implemented standard Auto-Regressive algorithm, Periodogram Estimation algorithm, and their combination.
    - Real-time (100ms) forecast of three motion variables for maximum 20 step

** Document Management Software for MS Windows
   - Time: 2004
   - I did this just for fun!
   - Description: \\  
     If I am a programmer of Microsoft, the first thing I want is to update its File Management System (FMS) for Windows OS. Under Windows 2000/XP, files can only have one name, belong to one folder, have very limited properties. These shortcomings force me to write this program. It was written completely with Visual Basic 6.0 and has been tested for more than one years. The idea is to manage files using a database engine, which will enable you to organize files by logic groups and to search much faster by a lot of means.
     - Development tools: Visual Basic 6.0
